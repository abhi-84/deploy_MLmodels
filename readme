In Decision Tree basd Machine learning code,add following 2 lines at end of ML notebook file:
import pickle
pickle.dump(clf, open('models/final_prediction.pickle', 'wb'))

These lines would generate machine learning model with name "final_prediction.pickle" which woulod be used in given files.

First run app.py file in terminal. 
Run another file request.py in another terminal and feed the feature values from database or new feature values and check the predicted output.
Enjoy!!
